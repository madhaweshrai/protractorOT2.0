1. Javascript in Asynchronous.
  - Every JS script returns a promise= it reflects state of our step.

Promise- Pending,Resolved,Rejected
code execution- Pending
code executed- Resolved
fails- Rejected

Sync call- Next step only when step have Resolved/Rejected status  = Java,Python
Async call- Next steps can be executed with Pending state also.   = JavaScript

Protector- 90% of API will work Sync like Java except few APIs.- All methods that r performed on browser
    like- click,sendkeys.
------------------------
10%- Gettext() method
    console.log();
exa- browser.get().then(function()
{
console.log();
})
